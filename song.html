                <h3>spring day</h3>
                <p>There's this theory regarding the Spring Day MV. Fans believe it indicates the horrific Sewol Ferry incident in which the ferry carrying about 476 people aboard, mostly secondary school students sank ,turning into a watery grave. It is said that the teacher accompanying the students survived but committed suicide after a few days, leaving behind a suicide note. In the note, she expressed that wished to teach her students her next life. In the song’s lyrics too, we have the line -
                    [Pre-Chorus 2: Jimin, Jungkook, V]
                    Maybe it’s cherry blossoms And this winter will be over
                    I miss you (I miss you)
                    I miss you (I miss you)
                    Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
                    I’ll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)
                    I’ll come for you (I'll come for you)
                    [Chorus: Jungkook, J-Hope, Jin ]
                    Passing by the edge of the cold winter
                    Until the days of spring
                    Until the days of flower blossoms
                    Please stay, please stay there a little longer
                    Here, the winter is used as a metaphor to describe the dark times and the Spring( finally end of sorrow) is when they’ll meet again. . After the incident, people wrote about their grief on the shoes of the deceased.Also, we see jimin by the sea,holding a pair of shoes with scribblings on them. At the end of the MV,we see a pair of shoes hanging from a tree and in Korea, that signifies death</p>

                    <h3>the truth untold</h3>
                    <p>This heartbreaking story is about an ‘ugly’ man who has locked himself into an ancient castle to hide himself from the world because he had received a lot of cruelty while growing up. Therefore, he tried to hide from people. The only thing that he confided in and loved was to plant flowers in his garden that surrounded the castle.
 
                        One day, a woman had trespassed into the garden and stolen a flower. The man was angry so he watched the garden from the castle all night. Unfortunately, when he slept the woman came again and stole another flower. Then after this happening for a few days, the man decided to fake his sleep and and watch the woman steal the flower. Without him knowing, he became more interested in the woman and began waiting for her to steal a flower every night.
                         
                        This was until he followed her one day to the small town and found out that she was selling the flowers from his garden to earn her living. He wanted to help the woman so much but was afraid that she wouldn’t like him because of his ‘ugly’ appearance. So he thought the only way he could help was to keep growing the flowers in his garden for her to steal and sell on.
                         
                        He decided that he wanted to create a flower that didn’t exist on the planet so that the woman could sell it for an expensive price. The Smeraldo flower.
                         
                        The man tried many times to make the flower and after many tries, he finally created the Smeraldo flower and filled his garden with it. But the woman stopped coming. He waited and waited but he found out she had died. </p>

                        <h3>pied piper</h3>
                        <p>In the story of the Pied Piper, a piper goes to a village and uses his flute music to lure rats away. But the piper later ends up luring the children away instead.
                            BTS uses this story as a metaphor for the relationship between themselves and ARMYs. It’s a known fact that BTS songs have the ability to “lure” ARMYs away from our daily responsibilities.</p>
