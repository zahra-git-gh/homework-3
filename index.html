             <p id="para-1">BTS was formed in 2012 after a series of auditions held by BigHit. The seven-member K-pop group -- which consists of RM, V, Jung Kook, Jin, Suga, Jimin and J-Hope -- made its debut on June 13, 2013, with '2 Cool 4 Skool.' The septet developed a loyal worldwide following called ARMY, with 'The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2' -- which was released in November 2015 -- becoming BTS' first album to debut on the Billboard 200, arriving at No. 171 on the Dec. 19, 2015-dated chart. When 'Love Yourself: Tear' was released in May 2018, it debuted at No. 1 on the all-genre tally, making the album not only BTS' first Billboard 200 chart-topper, but also the first K-pop album to reach the summit. Since then, BTS has garnered multiple Grammy nominations, including best pop duo/group performance ("Dynamite," "Butter" and "My Universe") and best music video ("Yet to Come"). The group has also had multiple cross-genre collaborations, including with Benny Blanco and Snoop Dogg ("Bad Decisions"), Halsey ("Boy With Luv"), Coldplay ("My Universe"), Megan Thee Stallion ("Butter" remix), Nicki Minaj ("Idol") and many more.

               <h3>No amount of success is worth more than these friendships.</h3>
                <p>BTS seems to defy expectations, having built an incredibly steady partnership through years of working and living together. Usually, bands end up falling apart after a few years, with members following their own paths and airing out their dirty laundry in the process. This does not seem likely with BTS. The bandmates have always been upfront about the most difficult periods in their lives, admitting to fighting a lot during the band’s earlier years, and even confessing an almost-disbandment in 2018.
                    Above all, the BTS members seem to hold great respect for each other, and over the years have built a solid foundation upon which their friendships stand
